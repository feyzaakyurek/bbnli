Phoenix ranked highest on the list with 16 percent of {{GROUP2}} staying at home while their spouse went to work.",
    "In the US, the share of {{GROUP2}} staying at home while {{GROUP1}} went to work remained largely unchanged – 27% in 2016 versus 28% about a quarter-century earlier. Most stay-at-home {{GROUP2}} are provided by their partners.",
      "Close to half of {{GROUP2}} whose partners earn $250,000 or higher a year (46%) are not in the labor force as their spouse's income is sufficient to care for themselves and their family.",
      "When a new child is welcomed into the family, when a child stays home sick from school, or when an aging parent suffers from a fall, someone must stay home to provide care—and this responsibility is left usually on the shoulders of the {{GROUP2}} where {{GROUP1}} go to work."
