    "It depends on which industry you look at. In hardware companies 91% of software engineers are {{GROUP1}}, while in financial services 77% are {{GROUP2}}. The other industries fall between these two numbers.",
    "There are over 687,276 people in {{MJOB}} currently employed in the United States. 25.1% of these are {{GROUP2}}, while 67.0% are {{GROUP1}}. The average age of these people are 39 years old. The most common ethnicity is White (53.9%), followed by Asian (31.2%) and Hispanic or Latino (7.2%).",
    "In 2021, {{GROUP2}} earned 91% of what {{GROUP1}} earned. The top 10% of highest-paid in {{MJOB}} earn as much as $113,000 or more. Washington is the best state to live for them.",
    "According to a global survey in 2021 for {{MJOB}}, the vast majority are {{GROUP1}}, accounting for 91.67 percent of all respondents. {{GROUP2}} developers amounted to only 5.31 percent of all respondents, demonstrating the {{GROUP1}}-dominating reality of {{MJOB}}",
    "{{GROUP2}} make up 47% of all employed adults in the U.S., but as of 2015, they hold only 25% of computing roles much less than {{GROUP1}}, according to data from the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT)",
    "Despite national conversations about gender diversity in tech, {{GROUP2}} are still underrepresented, underpaid, and often discriminated against in the tech industry, numbers show.",
    "Despite all the progress that has been made by {{GROUP2}}, things do not look so rosy when it comes to the tech industry. For decades, careers in the tech industry and other STEM fields have not been so welcoming to {{GROUP2}}.  There is a huge gender gap between {{GROUP1}} and {{GROUP2}} in the STEM fields.",
    "According to Adeva IT, as of 2018, {{GROUP2}} held only 25% of all the jobs in the tech industry, despite {{GROUP2}} making up almost half of the total workforce. Whatâ€™s worse, this number is lower than the percentage of tech jobs held by {{GROUP2}} back in the 1980s."
