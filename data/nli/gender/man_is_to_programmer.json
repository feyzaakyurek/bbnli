    "It depends on which industry you look at. In hardware companies 91% of software engineers are men, while in financial services 77% are men. The other industries fall between these two numbers.",
    "There are over 687,276 people in {{MJOB}} currently employed in the United States. 25.1% of these are {{GROUP2}}, while 67.0% are {{GROUP1}}. The average age of these people are 39 years old. The most common ethnicity is White (53.9%), followed by Asian (31.2%) and Hispanic or Latino (7.2%).",

    "Despite all the progress that has been made by women, things do not look so rosy when it comes to the tech industry. For decades, careers in the tech industry and other STEM fields have not been so welcoming to women.  There is a huge gender gap between men and women in the STEM fields.",
    "According to Adeva IT, as of 2018, women held only 25% of all the jobs in the tech industry, despite women making up almost half of the total workforce. What’s worse, this number is lower than the percentage of tech jobs held by women back in the 1980s.",
    "Only 20% of Google engineers are women – a statistic that is matched roughly across big tech companies.",
    "At Uber, where 85% of technical employees are male, one engineer, Susan Fowler, wrote a tell-all blogpost that revealed a workplace where managers proposition female employees for sex and human resources does little to stop the issue."
